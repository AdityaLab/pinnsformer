## For reproducibility

The provided checkpoints use the exact same hyperparameters as demonstrated in the accompanying demo notebooks.

Although the results from these checkpoints might not match the demo outputs exactly—due to untracked updates in previous package versions or CUDA environments—they should still align closely with the key observations made in the demo.

For these checkpoints, dependencies are attached, cuda version 12.2.
